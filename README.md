# MCTBotwo

MCTBotwo is a Discord bot created initially for the [Minecraft: Java Edition translator unofficial Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/wpD5sPD), but is now publically available and open-sourced. Its main purpose is to search through translated strings in different languages in orther to know how Minecraft stuff is called in a different language.

You can invite the bot by clicking [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=913119714400677899&permissions=2147483648&scope=bot%20applications.commands), and get command usage through the `/help` command. Since the bot uses slash commands, it is pretty straightforward to use.

If you want to use our code in any shape or form, please contact us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/t8dtssPmK2).

The bot was made by [MetalManeMc](https://github.com/MetalManiacMc), [Nan R.](https://github.com/Nanrech) and [SmajloSlovakian](https://github.com/SmajloSlovakian).
